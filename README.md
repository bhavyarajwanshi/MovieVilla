# MovieLand - Movie Search App

MovieLand is a React-based movie search and display application that allows users to search for movies and view their details. It leverages the OMDB API to fetch movie data and presents it in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can enter a movie title in the search bar and click the search icon to look up movies based on their search term.

- **Dynamic Display**: Movie results are dynamically displayed as a list of movie cards, each containing movie details such as title, release year, type, and a poster image.

- **Default Search**: The application performs a default search for "Batman" when initially loaded.

- **Error Handling**: If no movies match the search query, a message stating "No movies found" is displayed to the user.
